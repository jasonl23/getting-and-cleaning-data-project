There are two files. 

# run_analysis.R, which does the following.

 - merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
 - extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 - uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 - labels the data set with descriptive variable names
-  outputs a independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

#codebook.md, which describes the variables in the tidy data set
